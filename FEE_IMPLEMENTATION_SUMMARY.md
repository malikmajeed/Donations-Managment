## Database Schema Changes

```javascript
// New fields added to Students model
monthlyFee: {
  type: Number,
  default: 0,
  min: 0
},
feeStatus: {
  type: String,
  enum: ["paid", "pending", "overdue"],
  default: "pending"
},
lastPaymentDate: {
  type: Date
},
totalPaid: {

```

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:
1. **Adding Students**: Include monthly fee when creating new students
2. **Managing Fees**: Use the "Fees" button in the student list to access fee management
3. **Recording Payments**: Enter payment amounts and dates in the fee management modal
4. **Updating Status**: Manually update fee status if needed

### For Users:
1. **Viewing Fee Status**: Fee information is visible in the student list
2. **Filtering**: Use the fee status filter to find students by payment status
3. **Sorting**: Sort students by monthly fee or fee status

## Security Considerations

- Error handling for invalid operations

## Future Enhancements

- Fee reports and analytics
- Integration with payment gateways
- Email notifications for overdue fees

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test fee creation and updates
